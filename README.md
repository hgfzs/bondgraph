## libBondGraph
This is a C++ library to create and simulate standard and hybrid bond graph. The library support XML input and output of the bond graph structure. Graphic representation of the bond graph in SVG are generated using the Graphviz library. 

Features\\
XML input/output\\
SVG graphical output\\
Can simplify and compare bond graphs\\
Includes causality assignement and state equation formulation\\
Doxygen documentation\\
Use cross-platform CMake build system\\
